# Mini3D – Software 3D Engine in WPF (C#)

![Real-time 3D penguin Rendering](my_image.png)

Mini3D is a lightweight **software-based 3D rendering engine** written entirely in **C# using WPF**, built **from scratch without any 3D frameworks** (no DirectX, no OpenGL, no WPF 3D).

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the **fundamental principles of 3D graphics programming** using pure math and WPF drawing primitives.
